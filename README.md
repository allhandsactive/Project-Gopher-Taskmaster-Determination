Project Gopher Taskmaster Determination
=======================================
### an All Hands Active Project

What is this madness you say? Quite simply, if you're a member of All Hands Active, I'm going to be accountable for keeping you accountable, if you so choose. Want a deadline? No problem. Need fire under your ass? You got it. Are you the kind of person with no follow-through who needs reminders to get work done? I. Am. On it. At your request, I will harangue you until you victoriously shout "I'm Finished!" or hang your head in shame saying: "I quit, scrap that one".
