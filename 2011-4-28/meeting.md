State-of-the-space meeting
==========================

### Current Plan to build-out AHA

As it stands, those present see the need to:

+ Get a commitement from members that they're ready to step up and pay 50$ a month on the reg.
+ Give a commitment to members about the kind of things we're ready to provide for them to make us worth their while
+ Advertise that shit.
+ Figure out a way to arbitrarily incentivize to keep interest high (gamify it.)

So, here's what we're going to do toward those ends and report back by Wednesday, May 4. Folks should report to nate by email, in person, or send it out to the mailing list, and cc'ing nate. We'll also have a sit-down to be announced on May 1st to the AHA Shop list if anyone wants to firm up goals face-to-face.

Membership Commitment
---------------------
+ Xander will be sending out a survey to asses what is important.
+ Josh will notify DOps that we want the space empty by June 1.
+ Nate will look into an activity to celebrate the opening of the new section.
+ Nate will talk to the board to figure out price-points for membership specials.

AHA's Commitment to Members
---------------------------
+ Xander will figure out what's a resonable discount on parts (slightly above-cost?).
+ Josh will figure out who can teach classes and on what, and try to find 8 classes worth.
+ Xander will report back on the status of the Makerbot.
+ Xander will see what it takes to get us a miter saw.
+ Eric will find out what he needs to build a book scanner.
+ Mark will contact folks who are submitting floor plans for AHA and figure out if they'll cost any money.

Advertisement
-------------
+ J. Beard, Josh, and Xander will tweet, facebook or blog once a day about what's going on at AHA, or upcoming things from this list.
+ Eric will figure out a sidewalk advert he'd like to see.
+ Katie will figure out how to put rhinos on beans.
